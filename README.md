# IfcToolbox Cotranslation

Co-translation for IFC Toolbox GUI app.

## Request a language

If the language you want to translate doesn't exist as a JSON file yet, submit an issue so that we can create a template for you to get started.

## Submit changes

To translate, [fork this repo](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/) and edit the JSON file of your language. After that, [submit a pull request](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

Note that you don't have to clone your fork to make the edits; you can do everything on GitHub's webpage. Simply open a file in your own forked repo and click on the pencil icon to start editing.

## Translating

The translation JSON file consists of key value pairs. The key should give you a good idea of where the text is in the app.

To translate, simply edit the value. For example, where is "Settings" in French here.

```
"Settings": "Settings"
```

Simply change it to:

```
"Settings": "Paramètres"
```

## Existing languages

Here is a table of language code to language name, in alphabetical order. It should be noted that it will take some time to integrate into the App after the translation is completed.
